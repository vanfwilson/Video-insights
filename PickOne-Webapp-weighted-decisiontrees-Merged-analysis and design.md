## Why Previous Options Didn't Work

| Subtitle | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| "A Proven Path to Business Success" | "Path" metaphor rejected; "success" is vague and overused |
| "4 Strategies That Will Change Your Business and Life Forever" | Promises only "change" — many people are RUNNING from change (especially with AI fears) |

---

## Top Recommendations

### For Amazon Strategy Category

**#1 RECOMMENDED:**
> **Pick One: 4 Strategies to Create and Sustain a Profitable Business**

- ✅ Clear and direct
- ✅ "Create" covers those not yet profitable
- ✅ "Sustain" covers those who have it and want to keep it
- ✅ "Profitable Business" is the specific promise
- ✅ No fear-inducing language

**Alternative A (shorter):**
> **Pick One: 4 Strategies to Build Profit That Lasts**

- Punchier
- "Lasts" implies stability without promising "no change"

**Alternative B (with economic angle):**
> **Pick One: 4 Strategies for Profit That Lasts—No Matter What Changes**

- Acknowledges change happens externally
- Positions the business owner as stable despite the chaos
- The world changes; YOUR profit doesn't have to

---

### For Amazon Christian Stewardship Category

**#1 RECOMMENDED:**
> **Pick One: 4 Strategies to Honor God and Build Lasting Profit**

- ✅ Connects faith directly to business outcome
- ✅ "Honor God" is the purpose
- ✅ "Lasting Profit" is the result
- ✅ Works for both categories

**Alternative A:**
> **Pick One: A Faith-Based Guide to Building Real Profit**

- Emphasizes "real" profit (vs. prosperity gospel promises)
- Clear faith positioning

**Alternative B (longer, very explicit):**
> **Pick One: Faithful Stewardship, Real Profit—4 Strategies for the Believing Business Owner**

- Very clear who it's for
- "Believing" signals the audience
- Might be too long

## Analysis: Why "Create and Sustain" Works

The phrase "Create and Sustain" is strategic because it addresses TWO audiences:

| Audience | What They Need | Word That Speaks to Them |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Not yet profitable | They need to BUILD profit | **Create** |
| Profitable but fragile | They need to KEEP profit | **Sustain** |
| Worried about economy | They need STABILITY | **Sustain** |

Most subtitles only address one audience. "Create and Sustain" captures both without being wordy.

## Why Avoid "Change"

Your insight is correct. In 2025-2026:
- Business owners are exhausted by change
- AI fears are real
- Economic uncertainty is constant
- "Change" sounds like MORE work, not relief

Instead, we promise STABILITY through profit:
- "Lasting" = stability
- "Sustain" = control
- "No Matter What Changes" = external changes, but YOU stay profitable

---

## My Final Recommendation

For a book that could work in BOTH Strategy AND Christian categories:

> **Pick One: 4 Strategies to Create and Sustain a Profitable Business**

This works because:
1. **Clear promise:** Profit (not vague success)
2. **Dual audience:** Create OR Sustain
3. **Category flexible:** Works in Strategy; can add faith content inside
4. **No fear:** Doesn't mention change, AI, or economy in a scary way
5. **Actionable:** "4 Strategies" implies a clear framework

For explicitly Christian positioning, add the interior framing around stewardship, but keep the cover subtitle accessible to broader audience.

## Optional Tagline for Marketing

If you want a secondary tagline for marketing materials (not the main subtitle):

> "Stop working harder. Start working smarter. Pick ONE strategy and profit."

Or for faith-based marketing:

> "God gave you this business. Here's how to steward it to profit."

## A/B Test Suggestion

**Version A:** "4 Strategies to Create and Sustain a Profitable Business"  
**Version B:** "4 Strategies for Profit That Lasts—No Matter What Changes"

The one with higher response wins.
